      <p>When you least expect it, Nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot.
      Right now you may not want to feel anything. Perhaps you never wished to feel anything.In your place, if there is pain, nurse It.And if there is a flame, don't snuff it out. Don't be brutal with it </p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p>We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything, what a waste.</p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p>How you live your life is your business just remember, <span class="AMOR">our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once.</span>And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now there's sorrow. Pain. Don't kill it and with it the joy you've felt.</p>
